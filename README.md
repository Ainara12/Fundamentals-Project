# Fundamentals-Project

## Introduction

I have created this repository to submit the Programming for Data Analysis - Project 2020.
Please find below instructions and descriptions about what this repository includes. 

## Instructions: 

### Contents of this repository

This repository includes: 

* **Images & documents folder** In this folder I keep the images that I used for this project.  
* .gitignore file
* README file
* LICENSE file
* **Fundamentals DA-Project** Jupyter Notebook.

The project itself is included here and titled **Fundamentals DA-Project**.


In order to navigate through this Jupyter notebook just follow the instructions in markdown cells within the notebook. 
I have also included comments to my code in areas that I considered needed explanation or more detail.


## Instructions for project complexion: 

In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python
on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.
Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the
following items:
1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.
To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to
other types of regression on this data set. Rest assured, all the above concepts will be
explored in lecture videos and other materials in the coming semester.
